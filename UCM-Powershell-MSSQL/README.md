UCM-Powershell
==============

This is a powershell based implementation to collect performance metrics from Microsoft SQL Server.
Unlike the implementation in main page of the repository, it does not collect metrics for other services
but comes with installation script because of which the user is not required to create config.xml file
himself. To get the installation script, open your Uptime Cloud Monitor account -> Custom Tab ->
Getting Started -> Microsoft SQL Server and follow the instructions. The script will be downloaded
and you will be required to enter configuration settings for your SQL server instance(s). Post that,
a config.xml file is generated with the provided settings and service is started to monitor SQL instance(s)

##Synopsis
The module includes:
 - Create-Dashboards.ps1 : Creates dashboard when user requests to create (via -MakeDashboard option) and when configuring instances (during installation)
 - Create-MetricGroups.ps1 : Checks the existence of metric group everytime when the script starts and creates if not present.
 - SQL-Worker.ps1 : Worker thread script. Say if you are monitoring 5 instances, 5 copies of this script run on your system (1 for each instance)
 - Start-UCM-Monitor.ps1 : Script for starting monitoring job based on settings inside config.xml
 - Stop-UCM-Monitor.ps1 : Script to stop monitoring job for all instances.
 - UCM-SQL-Monitor.ps1 : Reads configuration settings and calls SQL-Worker for all the instances defined in config.xml
 - Utils.ps1 : Common utility functions are defined inside this file.
 - config-sample.xml : A sample config.xml, a usable config.xml file is created during installation. We don't recommend our users to change config.xml by hand unless they completely understand its structure. The structure is not too complex and you can play with it after taking the backup of main config.xml somewhere.
 - dashboard.json : A JSON request to create dashboard on UCM. Some values are configurable by the user and are picked from config.xml before sending request to create a dashboard.
 - metric_group.json :  A JSON request to create metric group on UCM. Some values are configurable by the user and are picked from config.xml before sending request to create a metric group.

This module provides a rich set of performance metrics for Microsoft SQL Server. The metrics monitored by this script are :

- Access Page Splits
- Cache Hit Ratio
- Checkpoint Pages
- Page Life Expectancy
- Batch Requests
- Connections
- Lock Waits
- Proc Blocked
- SQL Compilations
- SQL Recompilations
- Active parallel threads
- Active requests
- Active Transactions
- Backup/Restore Throughput/sec
- Blocked tasks
- Cache Object Counts
- CPU usage %
- Dropped Messages Total
- Errors/sec
- Free Memory (KB)
- Number of Deadlocks/sec
- Open Connection Count
- Page lookups/sec
- Page reads/sec
- Page Splits/sec
- Page writes/sec
- Queued requests
- Transaction Delay
- Transaction ownership waits
- Transactions
- Write Transactions/sec

This script monitors more metrics as compared to previous script which is in the main page of the repository.

All the errors and events are logged in C:\Program Files\UCM-Powershell\ucm-metrics.log

## Script Options

As of now, the script supports two options apart from the normal mode in which it runs :
- You can run the script in debug mode which will generate more logs (in case you want to see the flow
of code or you are debugging some exception). Open a powershell terminal, navigate to c:\program files\ucm-powershell\ and run

`Start-UCM-Monitor.ps1 -Debug`

- Dashboard is created for the metric group during installation but in case you want to create the dashboard again,
open a powershell terminal, navigate to c:\program files\ucm-powershell\ and run

`Start-UCM-Monitor.ps1 -MakeDashboard`

This will just create the dashboard and exit, i.e. **the script will not monitor your instances with this command**.

## Requirements

The script has been tested on:
- Windows 8  and  SQL Server 2012.
- Windows 10 and SQL Server 2014.
- Windows 10 and SQL Server 2012.

All of the above systems had powershell 3.0 installed. Apart from that, the script has following requirements

* Powershell v3.0 is required, you can download it from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34595)
If you want to check your powershell version, open a powershell terminal and run

`$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`

This will show you Powershell major version, minor version etc.

* A Uptime Cloud Monitor account is also required. [IDERA](https://www.idera.com/infrastructure-monitoring-as-a-service/freetrialsubscriptionform)

* If you don't have Microsoft SQL Server installed on a system where you are installing this, you need to install 3 packages from microsoft so that SQL modules are available inside powershell. Use this [link] (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29065)
 Download and install these packages in this order only (choose x86 and x64 accordingly)
 1. Microsoft System CLR Types for Microsoft SQL Server 2012 (search SQLSysClrTypes.msi in the page)
 2. Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Shared Management Objects (search SharedManagementObjects.msi in the page)
 3. Microsoft Windows PowerShell Extensions for Microsoft SQL Server 2012 (search PowerShellTools.msi in the page)

 After downloading, run this command on a powershell window in Admin mode : `Import-Module SQLPS`
