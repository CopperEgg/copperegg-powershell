UCM-Powershell-IIS
==============

Uses powershell to monitor Microsoft based services. It currently supports
 - Microsoft IIS Server,

To get the installation script, open your Uptime Cloud Monitor account -> Custom Tab ->
Getting Started -> Click on Microsoft IIS Server and follow the instructions. The script will be downloaded
and you will be required to enter configuration settings for your instance(s). Post that,
a config.xml file is generated with the provided settings and service is started to monitor your instance(s)

##Synopsis
The module includes:
 - Create-Dashboards.ps1 : Creates dashboard when user requests to create (via -MakeDashboard option) and when configuring instances (during installation)
 - Create-MetricGroups.ps1 : Checks the existence of metric group everytime when the script starts and creates if not present.
 - Worker.ps1 : Worker thread script. Say if you are monitoring 5 instances, 5 copies of this script run on your system (1 for each instance)
 - Start-UCM-Monitor.ps1 : Script for starting monitoring job based on settings inside config.xml
 - Stop-UCM-Monitor.ps1 : Script to stop monitoring job for all instances.
 - UCM-SQL-Monitor.ps1 : Reads configuration settings and calls Worker for all the instances defined in config.xml
 - Utils.ps1 : Common utility functions are defined inside this file.
 - config-sample.xml : A sample config.xml, a usable config.xml file is created during installation. We don't recommend our users to change config.xml by hand unless they completely understand its structure.
 - dashboard.json : A JSON request to create dashboard on UCM. Some values are configurable by the user and are picked from config.xml before sending request to create a dashboard.
 - metric_group.json :  A JSON request to create metric group on UCM. Some values are configurable by the user and are picked from config.xml before sending request to create a metric group.
