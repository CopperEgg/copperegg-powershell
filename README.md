CoppereggPowershell
=============

The Uptime Cloud Monitor Powershell module is a Powershell interface to the Uptime Cloud Monitor API, making it simple to create custom metrics and dashboards for Microsoft Windows systems.

##Synopsis
The module includes:
  - CopperEgg.psm1... contains Powershell functions that are wrappers for the Uptime Cloud Monitor API
  - Initialize-MetricGroups ... creates metric groups, and sends them to Uptime Cloud Monitor
  - Initialize-Dashboards ... creates custom dashboards, and sends them to Uptime Cloud Monitor
  - Start-CopperEggMonitor ... starts one or more background jobs that periodically transmit your metrics to Uptime Cloud Monitor
  - Start-DebugMonitor ... performs the same functionality as Start-CopperEggMonitor, but in the foreground, and with debug output.
  - and other utilities.

This module provides a 'Works-Out-of-the-Box' set of default metrics and dashboards for
  - MSSQL
  - .NET CLR
  - ASP.NET
  - IIS
  - and a variety of system-level Microsoft performance counters.

This module will replace revealmetrics-powershell, which will be deprecated. CopperEgg-Powershell is configured with a yaml configuration
file, and supports both local and remote monitoring.

As of 1.0.0, errors and events are logged. Look for logs here: Modules/CopperEgg/Logs

## Requirements
This release requires Powershell v3.0, which ships with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.
It has also been tested on Windows Server 2008r2 and Windows 7, with Powershell v3.0 installed.

You can download Powershell v3.0 here:
* [Microsoft Powershell v3.0](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34595)

A Uptime Cloud Monitor account is also required. If you don't have one yet, check it out:
* [IDERA](http://idera.com)

You will also need to install PowerYaml, which is used to parse the config.yml file.
The procedure will be detailed below.


## Installation

* Start Windows Powershell, running as Administrator

* Set the ExecutionPolicy to Unrestricted or RemoteSigned:

```ruby
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```
* Create installation directories for PowerYaml and Uptime Cloud Monitor.

The following instructions assume that you will install PowerYaml in this directory:

```ruby
"c:\Program Files (x86)\CopperEgg\Modules\PowerYaml"
```

... and copperegg-powershell in this directory:

```ruby
"c:\Program Files (x86)\CopperEgg\Modules\CopperEgg"
```

```ruby
New-Item 'c:\Program Files (x86)\CopperEgg\Modules\CopperEgg' -type directory
New-Item 'c:\Program Files (x86)\CopperEgg\Modules\PowerYaml' -type directory
cd 'c:\Program Files (x86)\CopperEgg\Modules\CopperEgg'
```
* Create a Powershell profile. If you have already set up a Powershell profile, you can skip to 'Edit your powershell profile'

There are a number of different profiles used by Powershell and PowershellISE, and they are in different places. :(
To see the choices, enter the following:

```ruby
$PROFILE | Format-List * -Force
```
The following instructions assume that you will create and edit the AllUsersAllHosts profile:

```ruby
new-item $PROFILE.AllUsersAllHosts -ItemType file -Force
```
* Edit your powershell profile to include a path to the Uptime Cloud Monitor and PowerYaml module directories.
Add the following lines to your powershell profile:

```ruby
Set-Location "c:\Program Files (x86)\CopperEgg\Modules\CopperEgg"
$env:PSModulePath = $env:PSModulePath +  ";c:\Program Files (x86)\CopperEgg\Modules\CopperEgg" + ";c:\Program Files (x86)\CopperEgg\Modules\PowerYaml"
import-module ..\PowerYaml\PowerYaml.psm1
```

* Clone the following repositories:

```ruby
git clone https://github.com/CopperEgg/copperegg-powershell.git

git clone https://github.com/scottmuc/PowerYaml.git
```

* Copy the contents of the newly-cloned copperegg-powershell directory to "c:\Program Files (x86)\CopperEgg\Modules\CopperEgg".

* Copy the contents of the newly-cloned poweryaml directory to "c:\Program Files (x86)\CopperEgg\Modules\PowerYaml".

* If the archive flags are set on any of the files in either of these two directories, clear them.

* At this point, you will need to create your config.yml file. Copy the config-sample.yml file to config.yml.

### Edit the config.yml file :

* enter your Uptime Cloud Monitor APIKEY in the the apikey field,

* set the frequency (actually the sampling period ... a value of 60 means obtain a sample every 60 seconds.)

* set the 'local_remote' flag as desired; local means the machine running copperegg-powershell will only monitor
those metricgroups called out in the server definition with hostname equal to that of the local host. remote means the
machine running copperegg-powershell will only monitor metricgroups called out in the server definitions with hostnames
NOT equal to that of the local host. Finally, if set to all, the machine running copperegg-powershell will monitor
metricgroups in server definitions of both local and remote machines.

* replace 'Server1' with your server name. This name field allows you to name your servers as you like; the associated
Server definition must contain the Windows machine name. (see below)

* Update the Server Definition (in config-sample.yml, the block at the end of the file beginning with Server1:)
Each Server Definition block must have a valid hostname, and a metricgroups section, listing which of the metric groups defined
earlier in the file to monitor. If this instance will monitor MSSQL (locally or remotely), you must also add a
a mssql_instancenames: section, and list one (or more) instances to monitor.

Save the file, and close it.

## Usage

####Load the Uptime Cloud Monitor module:

```ruby
import-module .\CopperEgg.psd1
```
####Initialize the default metric groups and dashboards:
```ruby
Initialize-MetricGroups
Initialize-Dashboards
```
####Start monitoring:

```ruby
Start-CopperEggMonitor
```
The module will set up a number of background jobs. You can continue to use your powershell UI, and the monitoring will continue.
Now go have a look at your Uptime Cloud Monitor UI, and you will see your new dashboards up and running!

####To stop monitoring:
```ruby
Stop-CopperEggMonitor
```

####To remove all loaded Uptime Cloud Monitor modules:
```ruby
Remove-AllCopperEgg
```

###To Run Your CopperEgg-StartMonitor.ps1 script 'as a service'

Specifically, these instructions are for ensuring that your monitoring powershell scripts resume running after restart or power-cycle. At this point, we do not support running the Powershell scripts as a Windows Service ... but using the Windows Task Scheduler, you can do very close to the same thing.

* As Administrator, enter the Task Scheduler (Control Panel-> Administrative Tools->Task Scheduler)

* Create Task General
  - Name CopperEggTask
  - When running the task, use the Administrator account.
  - Run whether user is logged in or not
  - Run with Highest Privileges
  - Configure for the OS you are using

* Create Task Trigger
  - Begin the Task On a Schedule
  - Daily
  - set time to current time
  - Recur every 1 day
  Advanced Settings:
  - Repeat task every 5 minutes, for duration Indefinitely
  Check the Enabled box. Other boxes cleared.

* Create Task Actions
  - Start a Program
  Program     C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
  Arguments   -noexit -File "C:\Program Files (x86)\CopperEgg\Modules\CopperEgg\CopperEggTask.ps1"
  Options field blank

  NOTE: You can select the 32 or 64 bit powershell executable. Above the 64 bit is specified.

* Create Task Conditions
  - Leave all boxes cleared

* Create Task Settings
  - Check Allow Task to be run on demand, Run task as soon as possible after scheduled start is missed, and if the task fails, restart every 1 minute
  - Attempt to restart up to 3 times.
  - Leave the remaining boxes un-checked.
  - If the task is already running, then the following rule applies:
    Do not start a new instance.

Close the Task Scheduler. CopperEggTask.ps1 should start (if not already started) within 5 minutes.
